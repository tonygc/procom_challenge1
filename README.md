Hi There!
The main script is in index.js file.
To run the mencioned file above please run this
    
    node index.js
    
This script iterates our objects array where i added myself, also contains a few validations and iÂ´m also mutating each element of the array adding the date property.

To run the sorting script please first run this

    npm install
    
That's needed because i use lodash to manage sorting.
When it's done you can run the following commands to sort the array sending a property whatever you need.

     node sorting.js Status
     node sorting.js 'Favorite Food'
     node sorting.js 'Favorite Movie'
     node sorting.js Name
